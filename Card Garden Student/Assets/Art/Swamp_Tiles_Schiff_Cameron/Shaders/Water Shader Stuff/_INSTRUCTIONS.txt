HOW TO SET UP THE WATER SHADER:


1. Everything is found in Shaders/Water Shader Stuff

2. Put CameraDepthTextureMode.cs and NormalsReplacementShaders.cs on the Main Camera

3. On the Camera, change "Depth Texture Mode" to "Depth"

4. On the Camera, plug HiddenNormalsTexture.shader into "Normals Shader"

5. If needed, details on what each property does can be found in ToonWater.shader, in the Properties section at the top.



Note that it might look strange in the Scene View; this is because it depends on information from the scripts you 
put on the Main Camera. Keep an eye on the Game View to see how it will look in-game.
